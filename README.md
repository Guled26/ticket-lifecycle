Steps: 

Ticket Creation:

Users submit support requests through various channels (email, web form, etc.).
Each request is converted into a ticket with a unique identifier.

Ticket Assignment:

Tickets are assigned to appropriate agents or teams based on criteria like expertise or workload.
Agents receive notifications about new assignments.

Ticket Triage:

Agents assess the ticket's priority and categorize it based on issue type.
Urgent issues may bypass the triage process and receive immediate attention.

Ticket Investigation:

Assigned agents investigate the reported issue by gathering information and context.
They may communicate with the user to gather additional details.

<p>
Ticket Resolution:

Agents work to resolve the issue, either by providing information, troubleshooting, or taking specific actions.
Resolution time may vary based on the complexity of the issue.

Communication and Updates:

Agents maintain clear and consistent communication with the user throughout the process.
Users are informed about progress and any required actions.

Quality Assurance (QA):

In some cases, a QA process ensures the quality and accuracy of the resolution.
Supervisors or senior agents may review the ticket before closure.

Ticket Closure:

Once the issue is resolved, the ticket is marked as closed.
Users are notified of the resolution and asked for feedback.

</p>
<p>
Feedback Collection:

Users are encouraged to provide feedback on their support experience.
Feedback helps improve service quality.

Archiving and Reporting:

Closed tickets are archived for record-keeping and future reference.
Data from tickets is used for reporting, analytics, and performance evaluation.

Knowledge Base Update (Optional):

If the issue and its resolution are deemed valuable, the knowledge base may be updated with a solution for future reference.

Continuous Improvement:

Teams analyze support data to identify trends and areas for improvement.
Processes and procedures are refined to enhance support efficiency.
